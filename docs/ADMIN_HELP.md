## Battle ⚔️
> **Admin/Mod only**

- `/battle create` — Create battle lobby (optional: role gating, max players)
- `/battle start` — Start your open lobby (requires min players)
- `/battle cancel` — Cancel your open lobby
- `/battle stats` — Show battle stats and leaderboards
- Admin: `/battle admin list|force-end|settings`

### Role Gating (Optional)
When creating a lobby, you can gate participation:

**Required Roles (ANY Logic):**
- `required_role_1`, `required_role_2`, `required_role_3`
- User must have **at least ONE** of these roles to join

**Excluded Roles (NONE Logic):**
- `excluded_role_1`, `excluded_role_2`, `excluded_role_3`
- User **cannot have ANY** of these roles

**Example:**
```
/battle create max_players:10 required_role_1:@Member excluded_role_1:@Muted
```

**Elite Four Mode (Auto):** Activates when 4 players remain — all reset to 100 HP, increased drama.
